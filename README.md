# Machine-Learning
The Repo is for playing around with Datasets and trying to apply some models to them.

Goodreads Dataset:
  Its a dataset of the metadata of some books from goodreads. In the notebook I try to see how accurately I can predict a book's average goodreads rating before
  reading it. K nearest neighbors and Decision Trees are used.
