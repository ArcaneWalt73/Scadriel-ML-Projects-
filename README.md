# Machine-Learning
The Repo is for playing around with Datasets and trying to apply some models to them.

0.Goodreads Dataset:
  Its a dataset of the metadata of some books from goodreads. In the notebook I try to see how accurately I can predict a book's average goodreads rating before
  reading it. K nearest neighbors and Decision Trees are used.
  
1.Lichess Dataset:
  A lichess(free online chess platform) dataset. Aim was to see how much of a chess match's outcome is predetirmined by factors such as player ratings, the opening
  played etc. I attempted to apply 3 models: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and KNN.
